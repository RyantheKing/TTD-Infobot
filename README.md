# TTD-Infobot
An informational discord bot for a custom card/discord game To the Depths. Includes spellchecker for incorrectly typed commands.

### Spelling check
The spell checker uses a list of existing commands that the bot knows and compares incorrect commands to see what commands are similar to the mistyped command. It then provides a list of possible corrections for the mispelled word.\
